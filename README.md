MinecraftCurse page: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/vanilla-magic
 
Vanilla Magic don't add any new ores, items or blocks.
The focus of this mod is to give player magic abilities and powers with only vanilla Minecraft blocks and items.
Learning and progressing is through the Quest and Event system.
You won't be able to achieve the advanced recipes and powers without getting the low level Quests.

Starting from Minecraft 1.15.2 Vanilla Magic has been rewritten from the ground up.
Version 2+ introduced new Quest GUI window which can be opened by pressing (by default) 'o'. <br>
Quest logic and data model has been split into 2 separate classes - Quest and EventCaller.
